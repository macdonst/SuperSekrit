You will learn how to implement various plugins and all about the plugin architecture in general so you can go build your own custom plugins in the future. We'll use the tools introduced in the first session and knowledge gleaned throughout the day to help solidify the concepts. You'll also delve more into the PhoneGap Enterprise offering and see a demo using a specific app that will show off some of the new features available."
